## MDP Toy Application 
Simple toy application demonstrating the value-iteration algorithm in the context of machining.
Contains code for open loop, closed loop and mixed policies.
Mainly included for completeness sake.

## IMES Model Simulator
The IMES simulator code is found in the `imes.py` file.
All code related to using it for simulation purposes is found in the `opt-cont.py`, standing for optimal control.
The main function in `opt-cont.py` should demonstrate how to use the IMES simulator code.

### Dependencies
The IMES simulator relies on the following packages:
* Python 3
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
You should have these installed prior to running the code, or you can setup a virtual environment with these packages and run the code.
